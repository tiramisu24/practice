A bunch of men are on an island. A genie comes down and gathers everyone together
and places a magical hat on some people’s heads (i.e., at least one person has
a hat). The hat is magical: it can be seen by other people, but not by the wearer of
the hat himself. To remove the hat, those (and only those who have a hat) must dunk
themselves underwater at exactly midnight. If there are n people and c hats, how
long does it take the men to remove the hats? The men cannot tell each other (in any
way) that they have a hat.


at least one person has a hat
everyone can have a hat

if only one person -> then the person will see no hats and will dunk themselves
if two people -> each will see one hat. Since that hat is not moving, they realize there must be more than one hat. And since they only see one,
they know that they should move
if three people
if more than one person -> person with hat will see hat
