Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and
column is set to 0.

def zeros(matrix)
  rows = Set.new()
  cols = Set.new()

  matrix.each_with_index do |row, i|
    row.each_with_index do |spot, j|
        if spot == 0
          rows.add(i)
          cols.add(j)
        end
    end
  end

  matrix.each_with_index do |row, i|
    row.each_with_index do |spot, j|
        if rows.include?(i) || cols.include?(j)
          spot = 0
        end
    end
  end

  matrix

end
