Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards. Explain how you would subclass
it to implement particular card games.

class Card
  attr_accesor :face, :color
  def initialize (face=nil, color = nil)
    @face = face
    @color = color
  end
end


class Deck
  FACE = {
    A: 1,
    2 : 2,
    ...
    face :value
  }
  suit ={
  heart : heart
  suit : suit
  }

  def hand
    #logic of what each hand of game looks like
  end


end

class Hand
  def value
    # if blackjack: then have a value that changes value of A
    # sum of values
  end
end

class Game
  def play
  # game logic, with checks on win
  end

  def win
  end

end
