Othello is played as follows: Each Othello piece is white on one side and black on the
other. When a piece is surrounded by its opponents on both the left and right sides,
or both the top and bottom, it is said to be captured and its color is fipped. On your
turn, you must capture at least one of your opponentâ€™s pieces. The game ends when
either user has no more valid moves, and the win is assigned to the person with the
most pieces. Implement the object oriented design for Othello.
