Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to fnd out whether there is a route between
two nodes.

def route (node1, node2)
  queue = []
  queue.push(node1)
  set = Set.new()
  until queue.empty?
    node = queue.dequeue
    if node == node2
      return true
    end
    unless set.include?(node)
      queue.concat(node.children)
    end

  end
  false
end
