Implement a function to check if a tree is balanced. For the purposes of this question,
a balanced tree is defned to be a tree such that no two leaf nodes difer in distance
from the root by more than one.

#find heights of leaf nodes
#see if difference is bigger than 1
def isBalanced (node, height)
  return 0 if node == @root
  return [0] if node.nil?

  heights = []
  left = isBalanced(node.left)[0] + 1
  height.push()

end
