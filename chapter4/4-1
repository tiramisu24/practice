Implement a function to check if a tree is balanced. For the purposes of this question,
a balanced tree is defned to be a tree such that no two leaf nodes difer in distance
from the root by more than one.

#find heights of leaf nodes
#see if difference is bigger than 1
def isBalanced (node, height)
  return 0 if node == @root
  return height if node.nil?

  heights = []
  if node.left?
    heights.push(isBalanced(node.left, height + 1))
  end
  if node.right?

    heights.push(isBalanced(node.right, height + 1))
  end

  min = heights.min
  max = height.max
  ((max-min).abs <=1 ) ? true : false
end
