Write an algorithm to fnd the ‘next’ node (i.e., in-order successor) of a given node in
a binary search tree where each node has a link to its parent.


def next (tree, node)
  idx = 0
  tree.each_with_index do |n, i|
    idx = i if n == node
  end

  if(tree[n].parent == tree[n+1].parent)
    return tree[n+1]
  elsif (tree[n-1].parent.nil? || tree[n].parent == tree[n-1].parent)
    return tree[2(n-1)]
  end

end
