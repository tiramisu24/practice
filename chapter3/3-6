Write a program to sort a stack in ascending order. You should not make any assumptions
about how the stack is implemented. The following are the only functions that
should be used to write this program: push | pop | peek | isEmpty

def Stack
  def initialize
    @stack = []
  end


  def push
    @stack.push()
  end


  def pop
    @stack.pop()
  end

  def peek
    @stack[0]
  end

  def isEmpty
    @stack.empty?
  end



end
