In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 rods and N disks of diferent
sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending
order of size from top to bottom (e.g., each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You
have the following constraints:
(A) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
(B) A disk is slid of the top of one rod onto the next rod.
(C) A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.
Write a program to move the disks from the frst rod to the last using Stacks

class Towers
  def initialize
    
  end

  def move()
  end

  def win

  end



end
