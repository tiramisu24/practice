How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, also has a function
min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in
O(1) time

class Stack

  def initialize
    @min_stack = []
    @stack = []

  end

  def push(el)
    @stack.push(el)
    @min_stack.push(el) if @min_stack.nil? || @min_stack[-1] > el
  end

  def pop
    el = @stack.pop()
    @min_stack.pop() if el == @min_stack[-1]
    el
  end

end
