You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single
digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1â€™s digit is at the head of
the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked
list.
EXAMPLE
Input: (3 -> 1 -> 5) + (5 -> 9 -> 2)
Output: 8 -> 0 -> 8

def add (list1, list2)
  list3 = List.new()

  node1 = list1.head
  node2 = list2.head
  node3 = list3.head
  rem = 0
  until node1.next.nil?
    sum = node1.val + node2.val + rem
    rem = (sum >9) ? 1 : 0
    node3.val = sum % 10

    node1 = node1.next
    node2 = node2.next
    node3.next = Node.new()
    node3 = node3.next
  end

  if rem
    node3.next = Node.new()
    node3.next.val = rem

  end

  list3
end
